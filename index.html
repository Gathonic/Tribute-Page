    <h1>Wangari Maathai</h1>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Maathai was born on 1 April 1940 in the village of Ihithe, Nyeri District,[4] in the central highlands of the colony of Kenya. 
        Her family was Kikuyu, the most populous ethnic group in Kenya, and had lived in the area for several generations.[</p>
    
    <h2>Quotes by Wangari Maathai</h2>
        <p> “Human rights are not things that are put on the table for people to enjoy. These are things you fight for and then you protect.” <br> 
            <br>        
            “I’m very conscious of the fact that you can’t do it alone. It’s teamwork. When you do it alone you run the risk that when you are no longer there nobody else will do it.” <br>
            <br>     
            “There are opportunities even in the most difficult moments.” <br>
            <br>     
            “The generation that destroys the environment is not the generation that pays the price. That is the problem.” <br>
            <br>     
            “When we plant trees, we plant the seeds of peace and hope.”

    <h2>Nobel Peace Prize</h2>

    <p>Wangari Maathai became the <strong>first African woman</strong>, and the <strong>first environmentalist</strong>, to win the Peace Prize.

        Maathai stood up courageously against the former oppressive regime in Kenya. Her unique forms of action have contributed to drawing attention to political oppression—nationally and internationally. She has served as inspiration for many in the fight for democratic rights and has especially encouraged women to better their situation.
